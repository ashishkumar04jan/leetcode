https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

Approach : to reverse the array, run a loop till middle and save value for Arr[i] and then swap the value with length-1-i.
In this way string will be reverse.
Maths.floor is used to take smallest valid integer till which we need to run loop


Solution


class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
      for (int i = 0; i < Math.floor(s.length - 1) / 2; i++) {
			char tmp = s[i];
			int val = s.length - 1 - i;
			s[i] = s[val];
			s[s.length - 1 - i] = tmp;
		}
    }
}
